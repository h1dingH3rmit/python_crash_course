# Python Crash Course Code

This file will list code written by me while I was following along with examples and "Try It Yourself" tasks from the text book. It is broken down by chapters and ordered by appearence. The syntax is simply *name* + _ + ch + *chapter number* + - *example number* (i.e. - *hello_world_ch02-1.py*)

## Examples

### Chapter 1
1. hello_world_ch01.py

### Chapter 2
1. hello_world_ch02-1.py
1. hello_world_ch02-2.py
1. hello_world_ch02-3.py
1. hello_world_ch02-4.py
1. name_ch02-5.py
1. name_ch02-6.py
1. name_ch02-7.py
1. name_ch02-8.py
1. name_ch02-9.py
